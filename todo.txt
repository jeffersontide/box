TODO:

- add random jitter (spatial + background color)
- drift mode between (preset) cool-looking states
- overlay for orientation
- auto-cycle seed colors
- mouse input:
	- left click + drag = move xy
	- right click + drag = rotate
	- scroll wheel = move z
- time reverse
- screenshots/videos -> online image hosting
- "poke me" mode
- local transforms -- in mobile, a user fruit-ninja slices across the screen 
    defining a line segment. The pixels in the vicinity of the line segment are 
    inverted or mirrored or whatever, and that effect fades out after some 
    distance.
	- More generally, local effects users can control. Local effects are more 
	intuitive, both for users to control and for incorporating into games, so I 
	think it would add some entertainment for people too lazy to figure the 
	feedback loops out. I'm imagining like touching the screen to seed a nice 
	shimmery dot of light that blends/changes with the surrounding edges.
- fading between scenes
- static image checking
- anti-strobe: difference checker or exponential averaging
