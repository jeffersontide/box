TODO:

- refactor/clean up
    - toolbar
    - input handler, setter/getter/comparison/copyload
    - cycler
- kaleidoscope/pie slice/snowflake mirroring
- push updates to toolbar
- kill cycling
- smooth transition when adding mouse/touch/keyboard input while cycling
- function that calculates which input set is closest



- add random jitter (spatial + background color)
- drift mode between (preset) cool-looking states
- overlay for orientation
- auto-cycle seed colors
- time reverse
- screenshots/videos -> online image hosting
- "poke me"/safe mode
- change delay for updating
- local transforms -- in mobile, a user fruit-ninja slices across the screen 
    defining a line segment. The pixels in the vicinity of the line segment are 
    inverted or mirrored or whatever, and that effect fades out after some 
    distance.
	- More generally, local effects users can control. Local effects are more 
	intuitive, both for users to control and for incorporating into games, so I 
	think it would add some entertainment for people too lazy to figure the 
	feedback loops out. I'm imagining like touching the screen to seed a nice 
	shimmery dot of light that blends/changes with the surrounding edges.
- fading between scenes
- static image checking --> stop rendering
- anti-strobe: difference checker or exponential averaging
- disable scrolling; disable zooming on mobile
- just for fun:
	systematic exploration of phase space, in blocks of camera parameters -- 	mass save images somewhere
	spit out matrix transforms as well, to make it easier to classify

- bool transforms shouldn't change over "state cycling"
